misc-scripts
=============

This is a collection of miscellaneous scripts that I've written or modified
for my use. Hopefully they may be of some use to others. When I get a chance,
I'll try and update this readme with descriptions of all of the scripts.

Unless otherwise noted, these are distributed under the terms of the LICENSE
